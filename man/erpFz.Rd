\title{ERP amplitudes at electrode Fz restricted to the 100 to 175 millisecond time window.}
\description{Event-related brain potential data recorded from 10 participants at electrode Fz (100--175 ms) in the context of Antoine Tremblay's PhD thesis (Tremblay, 2009). The actual raw data was averaged over variables \emph{LengthBc} and \emph{WMCc}.}
\usage{data(erpFz)}
\format{
  A data frame with 120 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{LengthBc}}{A numeric vector. The mean-centered length (in number of letters) of the second word of a four-word sequence.}
    \item{\code{WMCc}}{A numeric vector. The mean-centered working memory capacity of the participants.}
    \item{\code{Amplitude}}{A numeric vector. The avereaged amplitude of the recorded ERPs.}
